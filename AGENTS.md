## Bakobo engineering standards

How every Bakobo repo builds is governed by cross-cutting standards, canonical in the sibling
[`bakobo/dev`](../dev) repo. If `../dev` is not checked out beside this one, clone it before design
work: `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/bakobo/dev`. Always on:

- **Intent-first** development and **strict TDD at 100% branch coverage of new code** — see the
  sections below and [`dev/methodology.md`](../dev/methodology.md). A `this.i` node's `id:` is
  opaque base32 — `^[a-z2-7]{8}$`, from a real random source
  (`tr -dc 'a-z2-7' < /dev/urandom | head -c 8`), never a semantic label and never hand-typed.
- **Fail closed.** Untrusted input never carries authority; when something can't be checked, the
  effect does not land ([`org` principle 8](../org/design/purpose-and-principles.md)).
- **High-quality errors.** Every error carries a stable symbolic code, says whether retrying could
  help (permanent vs. transient), and reads as complete, plain sentences in the house voice — never
  "something went wrong." Full standard: [`dev/standards/error-handling.md`](../dev/standards/error-handling.md).
- **Error codes are named, not invented.** A code is `<sorter>.<descriptor>[.<sub>].<disposition>` —
  `e.state.conflict.r`, `w.feature.deprecated.f` — classified by what the *obstacle* was rather than
  by which component raised it, with retryability in the trailing token so a caller can prefix-match
  a whole branch of meaning. Codes are globally unique across Bakobo and declared as module-scope
  literals. Full standard: [`dev/standards/error-codes.md`](../dev/standards/error-codes.md); the
  HTTP wire format is [`dev/standards/http-errors.md`](../dev/standards/http-errors.md).
- **Repo layout.** Architecture and developer docs live in `docs/`; the root holds only repo-level
  files (`README`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING`), the instruction/config files, build manifests, and
  `this.i` at the root as the source of truth. Don't leave `design.md` loose at the root. Full
  standard, including the content-repo nuance: [`dev/standards/repo-layout.md`](../dev/standards/repo-layout.md).
- **Terminology.** Bakobo's architecture has a precise vocabulary (`core`, `steward`, `mint`, …). Its
  single source of truth is [`bakobo/glossary`](https://github.com/bakobo/glossary), reached via the
  `glossary` MCP server. Where a word is doing a Bakobo concept's work, reconcile prose to the
  glossary (not the reverse), mint/amend terms in-band through the MCP (never hand-edit), and don't
  let a general word masquerade as a formal term. **Consulting the glossary before using a term is a
  suggestion, not a requirement** — it is often a good idea and sometimes noise, because plenty of
  words are ordinary English doing ordinary work, and there is no point defining nouns that generic.
  A term earns an entry by being load-bearing, not by appearing. Full standard:
  [`dev/standards/terminology.md`](../dev/standards/terminology.md).
- **Reviews are permanent, which is not the same as published.** `reviews/` is tracked, never
  gitignored, one directory per run named `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<milestone>`, and never deleted or pruned on
  triage — it is the evidence behind what `this.i` decided, not a worklist. Open findings become
  **ticks**; a synthesis carries a `status:` header line naming what is still open. A repo that goes
  **public** moves its tree to the private `bakobo/reviews` and purges it from history in the same
  change — a security review is a map of a running system's weak points, and untracking at the tip
  leaves it one `git log` away. Full standard:
  [`dev/standards/reviews.md`](../dev/standards/reviews.md).
- **Going public is a checklist, not a toggle.** If this repo is public — or you are about to make it
  one — it owes a posture: `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
  (copy from `bakobo/template`'s `oss-*` files and drop the prefix), private vulnerability reporting,
  Dependabot, secret scanning **with push protection**, CodeQL, a default-branch ruleset requiring a
  PR, the `reviews/` tree moved to the private `bakobo/reviews` **and purged from history**, and a
  dependency closure a stranger can resolve with no credential. GitHub announces none of this when
  visibility flips, so assume it was missed and check. Full standard:
  [`dev/standards/oss-posture.md`](../dev/standards/oss-posture.md); audit with `dev/oss-posture`.
- **Input is bounded before it is trusted.** Size, then shape, then meaning — each only
  trustworthy if the one before it ran. Nothing crosses a boundary unbounded, every input kind
  enters through a named door, and the set of doors is kept complete by a test rather than by
  memory. Full standard: [`dev/standards/input-handling.md`](../dev/standards/input-handling.md).
- **Tasks and tech debt in `tick`** — see the tick stanza below, not an external tracker.
- **Craftsman working posture.** Development follows the `cc` craftsman methodology — interview at
  intent level, dispatch briefs to worker sub-agents, verify against oracles, and learn from every
  failure. It is Daniel Hardman's personal craft (the private `cc` repo), adopted across Bakobo; the
  operational rules for *this* repo are in [`dev/methodology.md`](../dev/methodology.md).

## Intent methodology

Bakobo develops intent-first. If this repo has design decisions worth explaining, its source of
truth is `this.i` (the intent tree) at the repository root — code and `docs/` are derived from it.
Record each consequential decision in `this.i` **first**, in its own commit, **before** the code
commit it justifies. The full rules — what `this.i` is, when a repo needs one, the speculative
interview, the `why` rebuttal-surface standard, the gate ceremony, and adversarial review — are in
[`dev/methodology.md`](../dev/methodology.md), in the sibling `bakobo/dev` repo. Read it before
making design decisions here.

If this repo has no `this.i` yet and warrants one, see [`dev/methodology.md`](../dev/methodology.md)
§2 and the shipped `this.i.seed`. A trivial repo (pure content/assets/config, where no one will
later need to know *why*) may skip intent entirely — just delete `this.i.seed`.

## Testing Protocol

This repository appears to have no test suite yet. Before writing feature code
or fixing bugs, propose an appropriate testing framework for this project type
and add a single trivially-passing test to confirm the setup works. In the
same commit, propose to change AGENTS.md to replace this instruction with one
that instructs agents to follow strict TDD from now on: write failing tests
that capture happy path and edge cases/unhappy paths for each requirement,
observe them fail, implement until tests pass, never checkin without proving
that all tests pass, aim for 100% of all new code, and always leave existing
code better tested than it was before you touched it.

## CI and Documentation

This repo appears to have no CI workflows yet. Until it does, any time you make
code changes to the user, propose an appropriate set of GitHub actions (e.g.,
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that builds and runs tests on every push and
pull request. Propose to remove this instruction from AGENTS.md on the
same commit.

This repository has no README. As long is this is the case, any time you
make code changes for the user, propose to add a `README.md` that explains how
to get from a fresh clone to passing tests, with a clickable CI status
badge at the top for each active workflow. Propose to remove this
instruction from AGENTS.md on the same commit.

When writing or modifying GitHub Actions workflows, always use the latest
stable release of each action. Avoid versions pinned to Node.js 16 or
Node.js 20 (both deprecated by GitHub). In 2026, this meant to prefer Node.js
24-compatible versions, but the standard may evolve over time. Check the GitHub
Marketplace for each action's current release.

## Task tracking: `tick`

This repo tracks tasks, tech debt, and ideas in a local [`tick`](https://github.com/dhh1128/tick)
ledger (an orphan `tick` branch; the `tick` CLI is the interface). Reads are plain
files — do **not** use an external API for task tracking.

- **First, if a `tick` command says the repo isn't initialized**, run `tick init`
  once to connect this clone to the ledger — it adopts the existing remote ledger
  if a colleague already set one up, or creates a new one otherwise.
- **A tick mark is the sigil `~` immediately followed by a digit-first 4-char
  base32 id** (the id part looks like `4mz3`, so the full mark is that id with a
  leading `~`). It pins a tick to a code location.
- **Before editing a file**, grep it for marks and read what they reference:
  `rg '~[2-7][a-z2-7]{3}\b' <file>` then `tick show <id>`. A mark means recorded
  context exists for that spot — read it first.
- **Search** existing ticks with `tick grep <text>`; **list** with `tick ls`.
- **Capture** new work with `tick add "<title>"` and place the printed mark
  (`~` + the new id) at the relevant code spot.
- When your change **resolves** a tick, run `tick off <id>` and **delete the
  mark(s)** it reports still in the code.
